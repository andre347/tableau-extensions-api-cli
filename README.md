# Tableau Extensions API - CLI Utility

Created: August 2019

**This is not created by Tableau and therefore not an official Tableau supported utility. Please contact me (Andre) if you find bugs or need help**

This utility allows you to quickly scaffold a manifest file. The extension manifest file (.trex) contains metadata for the extension and is used for registration. You need it for every extension that you build. You can learn more about this trex file [here](https://tableau.github.io/extensions-api/docs/trex_manifest.html)
